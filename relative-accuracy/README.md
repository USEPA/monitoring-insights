# Revaltive accuracy of continuous emission monitoring systems

EPA analyzed the relative accuracy of quality assurance tests (relative accuracy test audits, or RATAs) for continuous emission monitoring systems between 2017 and 2021, finding that the relative accuracy is stable or improving for all parameters and averages about 2.5.

The description of the relevant regulatory requirements and analysis can be found on the [EPA monitoring insights page](https://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/monitoring-insights): [Relative accuracy in EPA CAMDâ€™s Power Sector Emissions Data](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-05/Monitoring%20Insights-%20Relative%20Accuracy.pdf)
