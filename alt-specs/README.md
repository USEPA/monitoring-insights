# Use of alternative performance specifications 

EPA analyzed the use of the alternate performance specifications for relative accuracy test audits (RATAs) of continuous emission monitoring systems between 2010 and 2021, finding that as emission concentrations of pollutants decrease, more units are using (and passing) the alternate specifications.

The description of the relevant regulatory requirements and analysis can be found on the [EPA monitoring insights page](https://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/monitoring-insights): [Alternate Performance Specifications for Relative Accuracy Test Audits](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2022-11/Monitoring%20Insights-Alternate%20Performance%20Specifications%20for%20Relative%20Accuracy%20Test%20Audits.pdf)
