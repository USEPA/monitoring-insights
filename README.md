EPA's Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD) collects continuously monitored emissions data from electricity generating units (EGUs) to assess compliance with a variety of federal air quality programs. These emissions and related data comprise [CAMDâ€™s Power Sector Emissions Data](https://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/power-sector-emissions-data). CAMD regularly analyzes the data to resolve questions, identify monitoring trends, and discover monitoring insights. Many of these monitoring insights are posted to [CAMD's Monitoring Insights](https://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/monitoring-insights) page.

This repository includes the R scripts and data used in the published analyses, including analyses of:

* Invalid data and the use of substitute data 
* Relative accuracy (RA) results of continuous emission monitors using the primary performance specifications
* Relative accuracy (RA) results of continuous emission monitors using the alternate performance specifications
* Percent monitor data availability (PMA) for continuous emission monitors
